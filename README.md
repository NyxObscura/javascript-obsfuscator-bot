## Important Notes

- **Encrypted Main File**: The main logic file (`main.js`) in this project is encrypted to protect the obfuscation algorithms and ensure the security of the bot. Do not attempt to modify or decrypt this file.
- **Security**: Keep your bot token secure and do not share it publicly. If your token is compromised, regenerate it using BotFather.
